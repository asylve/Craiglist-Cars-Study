I am helping my uncle sell his 2011 Subaru Legacy 2.5GT which he owned for a couple years now. If you done some research, you know that this is a rare limited production car. As it is 6 speed Manual with a turbocharged 2.5-liter engine.
Car currently is under 69,000kms. The car is in good condition considering the year. He only driven the car in the city and commuted to work by transit, which is why is the mileage is low.
Interior is in really good condition as he try his best to keep the car in clean condition always. Car has never been smoked in or pets under his ownership.
Car is equipped with power windows, power locks, keyless entry, etc.
The car is stock, no mods has been done to the car.
Car has a REBUILT title due to the previous owner. The person he bought the car from said the hood, bumper and rad support has been replaced due to a minor accident. My uncle never had any issues with the car in his ownership for the past couple years.
Car has been inspected by an ICBC certified facility and had completed a wheel alignment.
Car is driven by a mature adult.
Reason of selling is because due to the pandemic, my uncle is basically working from home most of the time and doesn't need the car at all. Overall, the car is a great car especially because its turbo charged, spacious and a great all season car (especially winter season). It is equiped with Michelin AS3s with good tread.
The price reflects on the current condition of the car as well as its mileage and title. Car can be inspected at your expense.

Price is $13,800. NO TRADES, cash only.
